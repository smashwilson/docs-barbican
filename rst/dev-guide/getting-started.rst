Cloud Keep is a REST API that enables secure life-cycle management of keys
and credentials, called secrets, on behalf of customers. This is
especially important for customers who want to securely store and
retrieve credentials systematically, and enables customers to have keys
generated on their behalf based on their requested encryption algorithm
and bit length.

This document provides an introduction into the Cloud Keep and
explains how to perform basic API calls. You'll learn how to authenticate, send API requests,
and complete the basic operations for using the Cloud Block Storage API by using cURL.

For additional details
about all of the API operations, see the :ref:`API reference <api-reference>`.
